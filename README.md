# Sales Data Mart ETL
 This project involves creating a star schema for sales data using Microsoft SQL Server and implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). The data is sourced from the AdventureWorks dataset, cleansed, transformed, and loaded into the star schema for optimized querying and analysis.
